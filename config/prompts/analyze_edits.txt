## Instructions

Analyze the (AI draft, human edit) pairs above. Look for consistent patterns in how the human changes the AI's output. Focus on:

1. **Tone/style changes** — Does the human consistently shorten, lengthen, change formality, remove certain phrases?
2. **Structural patterns** — Does the human move the CTA, remove questions, add specific proof points?
3. **Channel-specific patterns** — Are LinkedIn edits different from email edits?
4. **Category-specific patterns** — Do edits differ for Hot vs Warm vs Cold leads?

Rules should be:
- Specific and actionable (not vague like "be more natural")
- Based on patterns seen in multiple edits (not one-off changes)
- Different from the existing rules already in place
- Concise (one sentence each)

Return at most 2 new rules. Only return rules you are confident about (confidence > 0.7). If no clear patterns emerge, return zero rules.
