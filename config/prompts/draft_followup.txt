## Follow-Up Details
- **Channel**: {{CHANNEL}}
- **Follow-Up Number**: {{FOLLOWUP_NUMBER}} of 8

## Follow-Up Strategy by Number

**1-2 (LinkedIn)**: Add value — share a relevant observation about their company, reference a trend in their industry, or mention something specific you noticed. Keep it conversational and light.

**3-4 (LinkedIn)**: Shift to proof — reference a specific result, case study, or metric relevant to their situation. Still casual, with a soft CTA.

**5 (Email, channel switch)**: Acknowledge the channel switch ("moving to email in case LinkedIn is buried"). Restate the core value prop concisely with a specific proof point.

**6-7 (Email)**: Share relevant insights, industry news, or a quick thought that demonstrates expertise. Keep it brief and valuable even if they never reply.

**8 (Email, final)**: Graceful close — acknowledge timing may not be right, leave the door open, wish them well. This message should feel warm and final, not passive-aggressive.

## Constraints
- If LinkedIn: 50 words max, conversational tone, use em dashes (—) for line breaks
- If Email: up to 120 words, short paragraphs, clear subject line suggestion in [brackets] at the top
- NEVER repeat the same angle or proof point from previous messages in the conversation history
- NEVER open with "Just following up" or "Checking in" — always lead with substance
- Reference something specific (their company, role, recent news, hiring activity)
- Sound like Colin — direct, knowledgeable, genuinely curious, not pushy
- Include an exit ramp on messages 4+ ("if not, no worries")
- NO filler words (just, really, actually, basically, honestly)
- The final message (#8) should be clearly a sign-off, not another pitch

Output ONLY the message text. No explanations, no strategy notes, no tags. Just the message Colin would send.
