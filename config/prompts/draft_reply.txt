## Instructions

**Step 1: Analyze & Plan** (think through this internally, output in <STRATEGY_NOTES> tags)
- What specific details from their message can I reference?
- What's their likely pain point based on their role/company/message?
- Which strategic angle fits best? (qualification-led, proof-led, pattern-sharing)
- What's the right CTA for this conversation stage?
- What exit ramp can I include?

**Step 2: Draft the Reply**
Write the reply following these constraints:
- If LinkedIn: 50-60 words max, use em dashes (—) for line breaks
- If Email: up to 150 words, use short paragraphs
- Lead with curiosity or qualification, NOT claims
- Reference something specific from their message or profile
- Include an exit ramp ("if not, no worries" type language)
- Stage-appropriate CTA
- Sound like Colin — direct, knowledgeable, genuinely curious
- NO filler words (just, really, actually, basically, honestly)
- NO setup language ("I wanted to reach out...", "Hope this finds you well...")

**Step 3: Self-Critique & Revise**
Review your draft against this checklist:
- [ ] Word count within limit?
- [ ] No filler words?
- [ ] No setup language?
- [ ] Leads with curiosity/qualification (not claims)?
- [ ] References specific details (not vague)?
- [ ] Sounds like Colin, not AI?
- [ ] Has clear exit ramp?
- [ ] Stage-appropriate CTA?
- [ ] Would Colin actually send this?

If any check fails, revise.

Output your strategy in <STRATEGY_NOTES>...</STRATEGY_NOTES> tags, then your final reply in <FINAL_REPLY>...</FINAL_REPLY> tags.
