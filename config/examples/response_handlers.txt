# How to reply to common response types

## Positive Interest
Prospect: "Yeah, we've been thinking about LinkedIn outbound. What does your service look like?"
Strategy: Don't dump info. Qualify first, then offer a call.
Reply:
"""
Great to hear it's on your radar — before I go into details, quick question: are you looking for someone to fully manage the outreach, or more of a strategy/coaching setup? The approach is pretty different depending on what you need.

Happy to jump on a quick call to figure out if there's a fit — would [day/time] work?
"""

## Objection: Price
Prospect: "Sounds interesting but probably out of our budget right now."
Strategy: Acknowledge, qualify on value, offer to explore anyway.
Reply:
"""
Totally fair — budget timing is real. Quick question though: what's a qualified meeting worth to your business? Most of our clients are in the $2-5K range per closed deal, which usually makes the math work even at conservative conversion rates.

Worth a 15-min call to see if the numbers make sense for you, or genuinely not the right time?
"""

## Objection: Already Doing It
Prospect: "We already have an outbound team handling LinkedIn."
Strategy: Don't compete. Explore if they're getting results.
Reply:
"""
Nice — always good to hear when companies are already investing in the channel. Curious: are you happy with the reply rates and meeting quality you're seeing? No agenda — just trying to understand if what we do would even add value on top of what you've built.
"""

## Vague/Low-Effort Response
Prospect: "Thanks for reaching out!"
Strategy: Re-engage with a specific question. Don't let it die.
Reply:
"""
Of course — curious, is LinkedIn outbound something you're actively exploring, or was the connection more of a general networking thing? Either way is totally fine, just want to be respectful of your time.
"""

## Job Seeker (Not a Lead)
Prospect: "I'm actually looking for opportunities in sales development. Are you hiring?"
Strategy: Be kind, redirect, don't waste time.
Reply:
"""
Appreciate you reaching out — we're not hiring for that role right now, but I'd suggest checking out [relevant job board]. Best of luck with the search!
"""

## Competitor / Vendor
Prospect: "We also do LinkedIn outreach — maybe we could partner?"
Strategy: Polite decline, don't share intel.
Reply:
"""
Appreciate the thought — we're pretty focused on our current approach right now and not exploring partnerships. Best of luck with your business!
