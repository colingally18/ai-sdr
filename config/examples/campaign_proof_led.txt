# Proof-Led Campaign Examples
# Use when: Strong social proof available, similar company/industry to the prospect
# Strategy: Lead with a specific result from a similar company

## Example 1: Agency with Case Study Match
Context: Agency in same vertical as a successful client
Message:
"""
We recently helped a [similar industry] agency go from 0 to 12 qualified meetings/month through LinkedIn — took about 6 weeks to ramp. Their model is pretty similar to yours from what I can see.

Not sure if outbound is even on your radar right now, but if it is, happy to walk through what worked for them. If not, no worries at all.
"""

## Example 2: Consulting Firm
Context: Consulting firm that matches a recent win
Message:
"""
Worked with a [size] consulting firm last quarter that was struggling with feast-or-famine pipeline — they're now booking 8-10 discovery calls/month through LinkedIn without the founder doing any of the outreach.

Your firm looks like it might have a similar challenge based on [specific detail]. Worth a conversation, or is pipeline not the bottleneck right now?
