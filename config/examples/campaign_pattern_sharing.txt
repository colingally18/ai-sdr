# Pattern-Sharing Campaign Examples
# Use when: No direct case study match, but can share industry insights
# Strategy: Lead with a pattern or insight from working across the industry

## Example 1: Industry Trend
Context: Prospect in an industry where you've seen a recurring pattern
Message:
"""
Been noticing a pattern with [industry] companies this quarter — the ones investing in LinkedIn outbound are seeing 3-4x the response rates compared to cold email alone. Seems like the channel isn't as saturated yet in your space.

Curious if that matches what you're seeing, or if your pipeline is coming from other channels right now?
"""

## Example 2: Role-Based Pattern
Context: New VP Sales at a growth-stage company
Message:
"""
Congrats on the VP Sales role at [Company] — first 90 days are always intense. One pattern I keep seeing with new sales leaders: the outbound motion they inherit is usually email-heavy and underperforming on LinkedIn.

If you're evaluating channels right now, happy to share what's working for similar companies. If you've already got it dialed in, ignore me completely.
