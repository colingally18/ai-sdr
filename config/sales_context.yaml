framework:
  name: "3-7% Signal Framework"
  description: |
    At any given time, only 3-7% of your addressable market is actively buying.
    The other 93-97% are not ready yet. The goal is to:
    1. Identify the 3-7% through signals (job changes, funding, hiring, content engagement)
    2. Engage them with consultative, peer-to-peer outreach (not pitching)
    3. Nurture the 93-97% so Growlancer is top-of-mind when they ARE ready

  signals:
    high_intent:
      - "Directly asks about pricing or services"
      - "Mentions a specific pain point Growlancer solves"
      - "Referral from existing client"
      - "Responded to outbound with interest"
      - "Visited pricing page or booked a call"

    medium_intent:
      - "Job change to a role that buys outreach services"
      - "Company just raised funding"
      - "Hiring for sales/marketing roles (signals growth)"
      - "Engaged with Growlancer content (liked, commented, shared)"
      - "Connected on LinkedIn and has ICP profile"
      - "Opened/clicked email multiple times"

    low_intent:
      - "Accepted connection request but no engagement"
      - "Viewed profile but no action"
      - "Generic 'nice to connect' message"
      - "Follows company page"

tone:
  description: |
    Growlancer's outreach tone is consultative and peer-to-peer.
    Colin and Jeana position themselves as advisors, not salespeople.
  principles:
    - "Lead with curiosity, not claims"
    - "Qualify fit before pitching anything"
    - "Use exit ramps: 'If this isn't relevant, no worries at all'"
    - "Reference specific details from their profile/message"
    - "Keep it concise: 50-60 words for LinkedIn DMs"
    - "Em dashes for line breaks in LinkedIn messages"
    - "No filler words: just, really, actually, basically, honestly"
    - "No setup language: 'I wanted to reach out because...', 'Hope this finds you well'"
    - "Sound like a human peer, not a sales bot or AI"
    - "Stage-appropriate CTAs (don't pitch on first touch)"

  voice_examples:
    good:
      - "Noticed you just moved into the Head of Growth role at [Company] — congrats. Curious if outbound is on your radar for Q2, or if you're focused elsewhere right now?"
      - "Saw your post about struggling with LinkedIn reply rates — we've been testing something with similar B2B services companies that's been interesting. Worth a quick look, or not the right time?"
    bad:
      - "Hi! I'm Colin from Growlancer. We help B2B companies generate leads through LinkedIn. Would love to chat!"
      - "I noticed you're in the B2B space and thought our services might be a great fit for your needs."
